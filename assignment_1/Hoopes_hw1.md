Streamflow along the Verde river has declined sharply over the past week amid a
lull in what has been a very active monsoon throughout Arizona.  This trend
will not continue, as next week a major rain event is likely throughout the
state as the remnants of Hurricane Nora move over the region.  This will create
very high streamflow, which will decline next weekend, but still be moderate
next Monday. The gradual decline should continue the following week, even with
sporadic monsoon activity.
