3/3: Nice work!  I like what you did with the graphs and how you have them embeded as links. Next time I would prefer if you actually put the graphs directly in the doc though so that you can include discussion. Part of the assignment was to describe your graphs and how you created them.

Forecast rationale - Streamflow along the Verde river rose well due to last week's rains, but dry weather is in the forecast.  However, according to past years, flow should not decline too much thanks to cooler temperatures.  Flow typically remains steady for the first half of October before rising in the second half.  For this reason, and because moisture may return in a couple of weeks, week 2's forecast is slightly higher than that of week 1.
