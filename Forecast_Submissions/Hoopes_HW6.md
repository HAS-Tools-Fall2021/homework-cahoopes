Homework 6 submission - by Andrew Hoopes

Forecast rationale - Streamflow along the Verde river rose well due to last week's rains, but dry weather is in the forecast.  However, according to past years, flow should not decline too much thanks to cooler temperatures.  Flow typically remains steady for the first half of October before rising in the second half.  For this reason, and because moisture may return in a couple of weeks, week 2's forecast is slightly higher than that of week 1.
