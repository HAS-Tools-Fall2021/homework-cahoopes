The remnants of Nora failed to deliver the expected rainfall in the Camp Verde
area, and streamflow remains lower on the Verde river than expected in last
week's forecast.  With the monsoon winding down, and hot, dry weather expected
over the next week, streamflow should decline at a rate similar to what it did
prior to the slight bump caused from Nora's underwhelming moisture.
