The remnants of Nora failed to deliver the expected rainfall in the Camp Verde
area, and streamflow remains lower on the Verde river than expected in last
week's forecast.  With the monsoon winding down, and hot, dry weather expected
over the next week, streamflow should decline at a rate similar to what it did
prior to the slight bump caused from Nora's underwhelming moisture.

# 3/3 -- Good Job. Next time though please remember to have a heading with your name and the assignment.
- Also you can keep all of your previous homework submissions in this folder you don't need to delete previous weeks.
Its nice to have them all in one place.
